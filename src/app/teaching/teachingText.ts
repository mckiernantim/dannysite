    `I’m an actor who teaches. I recently went back to school to get my MFA so that universities can pay me to do
          that. I’ve been teaching acting, dialects, movement, and puppetry in workshops for about ten years. At the
          University of Illinois, I’ve been a teacher of record and TA for several in-person and online classes. If
          you’re
          thinking about hiring me to teach, this page will give you most of the details.`,

    `I’ve been developing this class to be a repository for all the skills I’ve put to use professionally. I
          suppose
          at
          its heart it’s a devising class, but that’s a word I’ve personally never really used. I think of it more as a
          storytelling class. To tell a good story, you need the right tools. This class encompasses acting, dance,
          movement,
          improv, voice, clowning, even puppetry. The greatest challenge this year has been to figure out how to teach
          this
          class without physical contact between students, but I’ve found we are so eager to make connections with each
          other,
          six feet feels like nothing at all.`,
    `This is a
            one-hundred
            level class offered through the school of Theatre. I treat this like a class from the first year of my
            conservatory
            training. I found early on that even students who were taking it to satisfy an arts gen-ed credit want a
            challenge.
            Through physical games, improv exercises, structured solo performances, scenes, and monologues, I teach
            students
            what it means to pursue an objective, create character, and mine a text for useful information.`,

    `I’ve been TAing this class since I
            got
            to the University of Illinois. I had extensive stage combat training at the University of North Carolina
            School
            of
            the Arts under fight master Dale Girard, as well as professional experience in a number of productions. As the
            TA,
            my role has been to move around the room reinforcing the methods the students are learning, and to help
            connect
            the
            lessons to their acting work. I love stage combat and find it to be a wonderful challenge for actors. Nothing
            lets
            you know if you have or haven’t committed to an objective like a sword in your hand.`,

    `This online class covers everything a
                    curious
                    non-major might want to know about the world of theatre. All work is done and graded asynchronously.`,
